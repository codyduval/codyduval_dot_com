                  <p>Hi! I'm Cody Duval, and I'm a freelance Rails developer
                    living in Brooklyn, NY. I typically work on projects
                    that exist in the domain of food, restaurants, eating, and the
                    like. I'm happiest when working in Ruby, although I also consider
                    myself proficient in HAML, SCSS, Javascript and Postgres flavored SQL.
                  </p>
                  <p>While I've been tinkering in Rails since early 2012, it wasn't
                    until February 2013 that I started working full-time as a
                    developer.  Prior to that, I earned a living as a marketing and
                    operations consultant for start-ups. So in addition to my
                    <a class="next-slide">technical skills</a>, I also have deep
                    experience in product and project management, audience 
                    acquisition, and more general business operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>Since October of 2013, I've been working as a Rails developer
                    for 
                    <a href="http://www.craftcoffee.com/">Craft Coffee</a>.

              <p>I deployed my first Rails app in January, 2012, and since 
                then most of my professional work has been in Craft Coffee's
                <em>Rails 3.2</em> app.  Along with Rails, we use a fairly standard 
                stack of <em>HAML, SCSS, plain 'ole Javascript and JQuery</em>, served via Heroku.
                I've authored 
                <a href="https://github.com/codyduval/shipstation-ruby" 
                  target="_blank">one gem</a>, and while I wasn't a CS major in college,
                I have a good handle on 
                <a href="https://github.com/codyduval/JavaWorkSamplesSES" 
                  target="_blank">computer science fundamentals</a>. I author code in terminal 
                <em>VIM</em>
                  (multiplexed in tmux), and we deploy continously at Craft Coffee
                  via <em>CircleCI.</em>

              <p>Along with Ruby, I'm strong with <em>HTML/CSS</em> and in a framework like Rails, I
                often choose <em>HAML/SCSS</em> for the speed boost.
                I prefer <em>CoffeeScript</em> to plain old 
                JavaScript, and I'm currently working on a project implemented in 
                <em>Backbone</em> using the <em>Marionette</em> library. And while I've
                used <em>Pivotal Tracker</em> for project management, I'm pretty 
                convinced that it doesn't get much better than GitHub Issues for
                the day-to-day.

            <p>I've been freelancing as a Rails Developer for 
              <a href="http://www.craftcoffee.com" target="_blank">Craft Coffee</a>, 
              since October of last year. Craft Coffee was accepted into Y Combinator's
              Summer 2014 batch, and I was one of two engineers who helped launch a new
              Craft Coffee at the program's conclusion in August.

            <p>I recently built an ErgoDox keyboard from parts - it's a super fun project
              and I'm looking forward to building a second for the office.
            </p>
            <p>On the decidedly non-technical front, my daughter recently turned 1
              and has begun toddling around the house. I spend the mornings with her (usually
              with our dog and a croissant in Fort Green Park) before beginning work
              for the day.
            </p>
            <p>Although I am currently booked, I am generally available for 
              freelance or project based work.  Please email me via
              the contact information at the bottom of this page
              (glowing references are available upon request).
