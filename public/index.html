                <p>Hi! I'm Cody Duval, and I'm a web developer and consultant living in Brooklyn, NY. I typically work on projects that exist in the domain of food, restaurants, eating, and the like. I'm happiest building apps in Ruby within the Rails framework.
                </p>
                <p>I'm a relatively new developer, having built my first Ruby on Rails app in the fall of 2011. So while I no longer consider myself a 'newbie,' I'm still actively learning and leveling-up my skills. I also have deep experience in product and project management, audience development and acquisition, and more general business operations.</p>
                <p>Most days you'll find me in DUMBO, where I work out of the <a href="http://dumbostartuplab.com/">DUMBO Startup Lab</a>.  My complete CV is on <a href="#">LinkedIn</a>, or <a class="next-slide">slide over</a> to see a summary of my technical skills.</p>

                 <p>I'm strong with HTML/CSS and in a framework like Rails, often choose HAML/SCSS for the speed boost (although I like ERB, too).  I can get by in JavaScript, but it's probably my weakest area.  I'm looking forward to deploying a project with a front end MVC framework like Backbone, Ember, or Angular.js.</p>

                <h2>Back End</h2>
                <p>I deployed my first Rails app in November, 2011, and since then almost all of my work has been in Rails 3 or Sinatra.  I've authored one gem, I have a good handle on computer science fundamentals, and I try hard to write well designed, object oriented code. I use MiniTest, deploy to Heroku, and prefer Postgres to MySQL.  </p>

            <p>Outside of work, I spend most of my time in Fort Greene, Brooklyn where I live with my wife and our (small) dog.  I moved to New York from San Francisco in 2004, and I can't imagine living anywhere else.
            </p>

            <p>I like building and making things, and for most of 2009 I had a full bike shop set up in my dining room where I assembled single-speed bikes for friends.  My wife and I spend a lot of time thinking about food and the culture that goes with it.  We strive to sit at a table together for at least one meal a day, and when we can, travel to places where the primarly goal is eating. </p>

            <p>In general, I value time over money, friendships over acquaintances, and experiences over things.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Right now, I'm spending about 50% of my time working on personal projects (in particular, The Buzziest).  I just completed NYU's Advanced JavaScript course taught by Aidan Feldman (recommended!), and I am in the process of transitioning my various apps and projects to Rails 4.</p>

            <p>I'm currently reading Sandi Metz's Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby, watching Mad Men and Game of Thrones, and getting ready for a trip to Iceland in June.  My wife and I are expecting our first child in August.

            <p>I'm not currently seeking full-time employment, but I am interested in Rails-based projects where I could contribute on a part-time basis. </p>
