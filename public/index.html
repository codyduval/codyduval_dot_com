                  <p>Hi! I'm Cody Duval, and I'm a web developer and consultant living in Brooklyn, NY. I typically work on projects that exist in the domain of food, restaurants, eating, and the like. I'm happiest building apps in Ruby within the Rails framework.
                  </p>
                  <p>I'm a relatively new developer, having built my first Ruby on Rails app in the fall of 2011. So while I no longer consider myself a 'newbie,' I'm still actively learning and leveling-up my skills. I also have deep experience in product and project management, audience development and acquisition, and more general business operations.</p>
                  <p>Most days you'll find me in DUMBO, where I work out of the <a href="http://dumbostartuplab.com/">DUMBO Startup Lab</a>.  My complete CV is on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/codyduval" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, or <a class="next-slide">slide over</a> to see a summary of my technical skills.</p>

                <p>I deployed my first Rails app in November, 2011, and since then almost all of my work has been in <em>Rails 3</em> (usually with the so-called <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/rails-has-two-default-stacks" target="_blank"><em>Omakase Stack</em></a>) or <em>Sinatra</em>.  I've authored one gem, I have a good handle on computer science fundamentals, and I try hard to write well designed, object oriented code. I use <em>MiniTest</em>, deploy to <em>Heroku</em>, and prefer <em>Postgres</em> to MySQL.  </p>

                 <p>I'm strong with <em>HTML/CSS</em> and in a framework like Rails, often choose <em>HAML/SCSS</em> for the speed boost (although I like <em>ERB</em>, too).  I can get by in <em>JavaScript</em>, and <em>jQuery</em> and I'm looking forward to deploying a project with a front end MVC framework like Backbone or Ember.  I am also competent with <em>Git</em>, <em>Pivotal Tracker</em> and I author code in <em>Sublime Text 2.</em></p>

           <p>Outside of work, I spend most of my time in Fort Greene, Brooklyn where I live with my wife and our (small) dog.  I moved to New York from San Francisco in 2004, and I can't imagine living anywhere else.
          </p>
          <p>I like building and making things, and for most of 2009 I had a full bike shop set up in my dining room where I assembled single-speed bikes for friends.

          My wife and I spend a lot of time thinking about food and the culture that goes with it.  We strive to sit at a table together for at least one meal a day, and when we can, travel to places where the primarly goal is eating.

          <p>In general, I value time over money, friendships over acquaintances, and experiences over things.</p>

            <p>Right now, I'm spending about 50% of my time working on personal projects (in particular, The Buzziest).  I just completed NYU's Advanced JavaScript course taught by Aidan Feldman (recommended!), and I am in the process of transitioning my various apps and projects to Rails 4.</p>

            <p>I'm currently reading Sandi Metz's <a href="http://www.poodr.info/" target="_blank">Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby</a>, watching Mad Men and Game of Thrones, and getting ready for a trip to Iceland in June.  My wife and I are expecting our first child in August.

            <p>I'm not currently seeking full-time employment, but I am interested in Rails-based projects where I could contribute on a part-time basis. If they are in the domain of food, drink, or hospitality, then consider me doubly-interested.</p>
